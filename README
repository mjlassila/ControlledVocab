Controlled Vocab lets you create your own controlled vocabulary.

You can create vocabularies and assign which collections they apply to. Terms are assigned to apply to specific Elements.

Dublin Core Types and MIME types are available to include in the plugin configuration.

To create an xml file to import an existing SMALL vocabulary, look in the /files directory for example of the xml format to use.
